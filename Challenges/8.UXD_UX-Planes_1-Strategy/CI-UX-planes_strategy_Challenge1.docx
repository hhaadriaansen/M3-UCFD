User Experience Design.

The 5 planes of UX.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Strategy plane:

The idea:
During the Course of Code Institute you will be asked to make a full fleshed idea to the 5 planes of UX. 
As such it made me wonder what kind of "thing" would be good to focus on.
As a result i went brainstorming/discussing with my direct environment about this and came to 4 outcomes of what could be a good option.

(See the mind-map for more information:

What's worth doing?:
To put things in perspective of what has the most value and would be best project to start things with.
In order to get this more into perspective, i put the ideas on a scale of 1-5. 
With 5 being the most important and 1 being not important at this stage at all.


1: (5) - Resume.
2: (3) - Informative website about my Conversion-Syndrome.
3: (2) - First project for my tattoo artist.
4: (3) - First project for my logo design artist in return for my specialized logo.


As a result the Resume will be the targeted project.
