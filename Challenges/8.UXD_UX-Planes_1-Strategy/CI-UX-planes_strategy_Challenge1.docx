User Experience Design.

The 5 planes of UX.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Strategy plane:

The idea:
During the Course of Code Institute you will be asked to make a full fleshed idea to the 5 planes of UX. 
As such it made me wonder what kind of "thing" would be good to focus on.
As a result i went brainstorming/discussing with my direct environment about this and came to 4 outcomes of what could be a good option.

(See the mind-map for more information:

What's worth doing?:
To put things in perspective of what has the most value and would be best project to start things with.
In order to get this more into perspective, i put the ideas on a scale of 1-5. 
With 5 being the most important and 1 being not important at this stage at all.


1: (5) - Resume.
2: (3) - Informative website about Conversion-Syndrome.
3: (2) - First project for my tattoo artist.
4: (3) - First project for my logo design artist in return for my specialized logo.


As a result the Resume will be the targeted project.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Product Goals:

- Name: 
As this is my personal resume website the resume website would be my name.
For example: https://HaroldAdriaansen.com

- Brand:
To get my personal brand out there and to have future recognition, i think that this will be the first step into getting my name out there.
Also next to that im busy talking with someone to create a logo for me.

- Image: 
At this moment i didn't have a real clear image of how i want my brand or my resume to look like. But this will come when going deeper into the other planes. 

- Features:
After some brainstorming and creating a mind-map for myself i found myself thinking about the core features that we will need for the website. 
(For the Mind-map see: Mind-map-Idea-Features.)
Of course this will be further explored along the way.

For now the first idea: 
- Resume link or resume itself.
- Logo
- Interactive tiles with topics:
  Tile 1: Video presentation: Where in you present yourself and the page.
  Tile 2: Education / skill-set.
  Tile 3: Work portfolio.
  Tile 4: Git Hub repositories & projects.
  Tile 5: VS-code, Cloud9 other languages/ Tools used.
  Tile 6: Hobbies / Something funny
  Tile 7: Work Experience.
  Tile 8: Contact form:
    -- Option to send directly files for application. 
    -- Social media implementation.
    For example: Linked-in.
  Tile 9: Pictures.
  Tile 10: about myself/ Biography.

- Marketing:
As for marketing strategy i will be using the No marketing strategy. 


- Goals: 
But will use the website as a starting point of creating Online awareness.
Also this will not only give me practical knowledge and experience in creating something new for myself during my study.
But also will it give me a personal perspective of where my strengths/weaknesses lie & how to improve on those even further.

Next to that This resume website will be used as my business card & proof of capabilities for future job opportunities, so that regular traditional companies or recruiters can see who they are dealing with.
