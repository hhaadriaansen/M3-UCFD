User Experience Design.

The 5 planes of UX.


Recap previous planes:
In the strategy plane i decided to make a personal resume website for myself. 
I concluded that this would be beneficial for recruiters and companies to get in contact and to help me create online awareness of my brand/person.

Also i made a Mind-map idea of the features/ content it should have which we will define more in the upcoming scope plane. 

For now the first idea: 
- Resume link or resume itself.
- Logo
- Interactive tiles with topics:
  Tile 1: Video presentation: Where in you present yourself and the page.
  Tile 2: Education / skill-set.
  Tile 3: Work portfolio.
  Tile 4: Git Hub repositories & projects.
  Tile 5: VS-code, Cloud9 other languages/ Tools used.
  Tile 6: Hobbies / Something funny
  Tile 7: Work Experience.
  Tile 8: Contact form:
    -- Option to send directly files for application. 
    -- Social media implementation.
    For example: Linked-in.
  Tile 9: Pictures.
  Tile 10: about myself/ Biography.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Scope plane:

Here we have to make certain choices as to What / When we are going to include in the current output. 

We are going to look at the following questions:

- What features / content requirements are needed to be included for our product design?
(Based on our business goals, strategy plane outcome & research )

- Functional specifications: 
What is the Feature set?

- Content specifications: 
What content is required to provide value?

- What is the value of each feature / content for our website?
(So what will be on / off the table with the upcoming initial (MVP) release and what will come after that in a future update?)

So lets start!
----------------------------------------------------------------

1: What features / content requirements are needed to be included for our product design?

After a brainstorm with multiple people and in combination of the first idea feature mash-up & online research, I made a decision about which features/contents are needed into this project.

- feature requirements:
1: Navigation through different navigational tiles towards the different content information.
2: Watch video of myself giving an intro & directions to the website. 
3: Contacting information and contacting opportunity for recruiters / companies. 
4: downloading my resume for a more traditional sense of application.
5: Working chat function.
6: Links to Github repositories or targeted social media applications.
7: Intro animation feature.
8: Personal funny features for about me or something funny.


- Content requirements: 
1: Personal video content. 
2: Logo image.
3: Personal picture.
4: Personal information.
5: Work history.
6: Skill-set /Tool summary.
7: Educational summary.
8: Undertaken projects / collaborations.
9: contacting information options.
10: links to social media / github repositories.
11: Hobbies or funny content: 
-- (Travel map which pinpoints where I've been to)
-- (Code written feature)
-- (something im currently busy with 
-- (what i like /dislike to give it a more personal flavour!)
-- (personalized map/ calender as to what im doing currently and what to do in future.)
12: Personal pitch for collaborators / recruiters / companies.

- Content/ Feature value:
As we do not have unlimited resources available to work with given the available time and skill-set needed for this project it is imperative to create a structured build-up in different releases.
In that light i will see what the core /must have features /content are.
And see what has to be included in the MPV/Initial release in the initial release stage of this website. 
and in the next 2 updates.
Keep in mind that this is a flexible layout and that it will be changed if necessary to avoid Slippage & Scope Creep.


1st step:
I will determine the value of the features and content. 

- feature requirements: 
(Value of importance 1-5) / (Viability or Feasibility 1-3)

1: Navigation through different navigational tiles towards the different content information.  
5 / 2

2: Watch video of myself giving an intro & directions to the website. 
3 / 3

3: Contacting information and contacting opportunity for recruiters / companies. 
5 / 1

4: downloading my resume for a more traditional sense of application.
5 / 1

5: Working chat function.
2 / 3

6: Links to Github repositories or targeted social media applications.
1 / 3

7: Intro animation feature.
3 / 3

8: Personal funny features for about me or something funny.
2 / 2


- Content requirements: 
1: Personal video content. 
3 / 3

2: Logo image.
4 / 1

3: Personal picture.
5 / 1

4: Personal information.
5 / 1

5: Work history.
5 / 1

6: Skill-set /Tool summary.
5 / 1

7: Educational summary.
5 / 1

8: Undertaken projects / collaborations.
4 / 2

9: contacting information options.
5 / 2

10: links to social media / github repositories.
3 / 2

11: Hobbies or funny content: 
1 / 3
-- (Travel map which pinpoints where I've been to)
-- (Code written feature)
-- (something im currently busy with 
-- (what i like /dislike to give it a more personal flavour!)
-- (personalized map/ calender as to what im doing currently and what to do in future.)

12: Personal pitch for collaborators / recruiters / companies.
3 / 2
        +
-------
36 points respectively i difficulty when summed up.
As we want 3 releases it will be 36:3 = 12 points per release.


2nd step: 
As decided earlier I will make at least 3 releases. 
Here in step 2, I group see to the scope trade offs.
As such we will refine the content / features against te businessgoals and see what is a must-have feature/content for this MVP / Initial product release.
(As a guideline we will have 12 point maximum in difficulty per release.)

-MVP (Initial release):
1: Navigation through different navigational tiles towards the different content information.  
2: Logo image.
3: Personal picture.
4: Personal information.
5: Work history.
6: Skill-set /Tool summary.
7: Educational summary.
8: Personal pitch for collaborators / recruiters / companies.
9: Contacting information and contacting opportunity for recruiters / companies. 
10: downloading my resume for a more traditional sense of application.

-2nd release:
1: Intro animation feature.
2: Personal funny features for about me or something funny.
3: Undertaken projects / collaborations.
4: contacting information options.
5: links to social media / github repositories.
6: Links to Github repositories or targeted social media applications.


-3rd release: 
1: Watch video of myself giving an intro & directions to the website. FEATURE
2: Personal video CONTENT. 
3: Working chat function.
4: Hobbies or funny content: 
-- (Travel map which pinpoints where I've been to)
-- (Code written feature)
-- (something im currently busy with 
-- (what i like /dislike to give it a more personal flavour!)
-- (personalized map/ calender as to what im doing currently and what to do in future.)

Of course this can be extended to more updates if necessary.
But this is the layout plan as for now.
